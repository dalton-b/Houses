BUGS

Number cap on pages probably doesn't work correctly, it hasn't been thoroughly tested || TO-DO



FIXED
Some prices showing too high (maybe not being averaged?) || DONE (They used 99999 randomly)
Seems to only work for Manchester || DONE (I had hard-coded in Machester where we get the website list)
Program will ignore apartments on lat 0 or lng 0 (Spider.parseHTML) || DONE (I think it was a mistake to include the problematic line of code in the first place)
Some prices are appearing as NaN || DONE (Buildings without 1 bedroom apts were showing price as NaN)
Pins don't appear before map is scrolled || DONE (Needed to add overlay to map before adding markers to overlay: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30173888/gmap-net-marker-initially-in-incorrect-position)
Prices around $50,000 || DONE (Was using the wrong index out of the price regex for some matches)
Lots of apartments are appearing under "Added to website list: " but not showing up as pins || DONE (Not sure what this was, but fixing the above price issue seemed to fix it)


TO-DO LIST
Home objects are stored in both a hashset and list in Form1, I can probably get away with just using one or the other || TO-DO
Use multiple regexes at once to increase speed || TO-DO
Run over an entire state? Country? (Should probably insert pauses so I don't DDoS them)|| TO-DO
Store info to a database so I can access it any time ||TO-DO





DONE
Allow different domain inputs (right now 'Manchester' is built in to the code) || DONE
Pin color should be relative to price of results || DONE
Insert a cap, so you can retrieve the first x apartments it find, and not 500 || DONE
