Bug Tracking Database

Bug || Fixed Date
Pins don't appear before map is scrolled || TO-DO


FIXED
Some prices showing too high (maybe not being averaged?) || DONE (They used 99999 randomly)
Seems to only work for Manchester || DONE (I had hard-coded in Machester where we get the website list)
Program will ignore apartments on lat 0 or lng 0 (Spider.parseHTML) || DONE (I think it was a mistake to include the problematic line of code in the first place)


TO-DO List
Pin color should be relative to price of results || TO-DO
Home objects are stored in both a hashset and list in Form1, I can probably get away with just using one or the other || TO-DO

DONE
Allow different domain inputs (right now 'Manchester' is built in to the code) || DONE
